Just fooling around with p5play while waiting for my students to ask me questions.

Space bar toggles the sounds (a mute indicator is in the upper right corner).

Get the plungers and toilet paper.

Avoid the toilets, or you'll get flushed.

*An interesting detail is that the game has fixed numbers of blocks, toilets, etc. so changing the size of the window (and reloading) changes the density of objects - which in turn changes the difficulty of the game.*
